    "**Setting Transaction Isolation Levels including DBAPI Autocommit :**\n",
    "\n",
    "These are traditionally the four levels “READ UNCOMMITTED”, “READ COMMITTED”, “REPEATABLE READ” and “SERIALIZABLE”.\n",
    "\n",
    "DBAPIs that support isolation levels also usually support the concept of *true “autocommit”*, which means that the DBAPI connection itself will be placed into a *non-transactional autocommit mode*\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLAlchemy treats the concept of “autocommit” like any other isolation level; in that it is an isolation level that loses not only “read committed” but also loses atomicity."
