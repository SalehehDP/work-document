    The module implements three types of queue, which differ only in the order in which the entries are retrieved
    
    - FIFO (first in firs out)
    - LIFO (last in first out) : the most recently added entry is the first retrieved (operating like a stack)
    -priority queue :  the entries are kept sorted (using the heapq module) and the lowest valued entry is retrieved first.
